# Aimee Back-End

Here is where I practice Ruby on Rails

This will be an API for an Ember front-end.

Goals
1. Practice Ruby on Rails
1. Set up a User model
1. {JSON:API} compliant 

App Idea

Aimee (Artificial Intelligence - Me) is a Twitter clone that generates user profiles based on sentiment analysis of their comments. I'll see how far this gets :)
